FreeBSD Coin Ports
==================

These are FreeBSD Ports for several alternative crypto currencies (Altcoins) that are not officionaly part of the FreeBSD ports tree. These are basicly shell archives that you would download and extract to your ports/net-p2p folder.  Then run "make install clean".  Complete instructions on how to use these files can be found at:
